# Adopting-virtual-pets
This program is a simple interactive console application for adopting virtual pets. It provides a menu of different types of pets that can be adopted, such as dogs, cats, fish, rabbits, and parrots. The user is prompted to make a selection by entering a corresponding number.

Once the user selects a pet type, they are asked to provide the name and color of the pet. The program then displays the information of the adopted pet, including its adoption cost, name, type, color, mood, and a corresponding action or behavior. For example, if the pet is sick, it may whine and have sad dog eyes, while a naughty cat may scratch the curtains.

After adopting one or more pets, the user can access a pet processing menu. This menu provides options to print all the pet information or print a list of the pet names. Additionally, the user can choose to quit the program.

The program maintains a record of the adopted pets and allows the user to view their details or perform further actions. It simulates the adoption and management of virtual pets, providing a simple and interactive experience.
